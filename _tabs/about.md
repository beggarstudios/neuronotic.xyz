# Neuronotic: Harnessing Chaos for Creativity

**Neuronotic** is a vault of interconnected notes designed to show how bottom-up thinking can assist neurodivergent individuals in developing creative thinking and harnessing their chaotic energy.  

As a neurodivergent person, I can attest that we don't always have control over our focus. We often lose track of what we're doingâ€”or even what we're thinking about.

### Embracing the Chaos

In other words: **we are chaotic**.  
This means we don't function like your average neurotypical person. However, there are ways to harness this chaos to:  

- Think more clearly  
- Create emergent structures  
- Develop an insightful network of interconnected notes  

This process helps us think deeply and draw valuable conclusions from our unique thought patterns.
